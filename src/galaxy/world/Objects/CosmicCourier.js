It is the result of an intensive literature review that synthesized 45 peer-reviewed research papers on the topics of game-based learning and STEM education. This game contributes to the field of game-based learning by highlighting practical development strategies which address implementation challenges and uncertainties associated with educational games.<br><br>This was a solo-developed 100-hour project that containerizes STEM topics into serious game mechanics and objectives. Currently demonstrated in the game is Stoichiometry, code execution, and coordinate system navigation.<br><br>This game may be played on itch.io <a href=https://zadega.itch.io/cosmic-courier>here</a>.",
