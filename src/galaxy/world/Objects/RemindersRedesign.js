A single iteration of the design lifecycle includes needfinding, design alternatives, prototyping, and evaluation.<br><br> I began by performing user research on the current state of the Reminders application to identify current shortcomings of the implementation--this yielded ~50 survey responses and 5 interviews. With that data I brainstormed many alternatives to the current interface and developed 3 low-fidelity prototypes. Upon evaluating the prototypes from another pass of user research I created an interactive medium-fidelity prototype of the interface in Figma.",
